Subject: Request for Meeting on Desktop OS Migration Discussion

Dear [BU Name/Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We would like to initiate a discussion regarding the upcoming desktop OS migration for your Business Unit. To align on requirements, scope, and planning, we request your availability for a meeting at your earliest convenience. Kindly share suitable date and time slots.

For your reference, another Business Unit is currently undergoing a migration covering 5,000+ users, being executed in multiple phases. Their user communication and coordination efforts are being handled directly by the BU itself. Once their migration is completed, we will proceed with the next phase, which includes your BU.

We look forward to your response and a productive discussion ahead.
